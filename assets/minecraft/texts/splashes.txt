Go Elkia!
The number one
Cao is best wizard
I bet Tommin is AFK
Is Kantor still having connection issues?
Anybody remember 'The War'?
Go Team Admin!
Cao was here
Elkia best server
Stray Wither? Call Anubis!
Will we ever finish making spawn town grassy?!
Hi mom!
Hi mum!
Cerx is up to something...
Blame Cao
Blame Cerx
Blame Ryan
Better safe than Stormstep
Slightly above average!
The penguins are chirping
Hey, hey, excited for cense-day?
Do you believe in magic?
Up all night for good fun
Sugar, spice and everything nice
Blasting off again!
Live life, breathe air
The kids are off to Fortnite now
best served with the milk separately
empty inside, just like #landmarks
fueled by k-vin diesel
we have drunk @techsupport
now with rubber duck skins for swords
Survived Kantorama!
Welcome back, SethBling here
I'm doing my part!
Ryan can't post gifs here!
