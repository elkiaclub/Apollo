# Apollo
The Elkia resourcepack, featuring **custom models** and some random stuff we used to tweak things around on [Elkia](https://elkia.club).

**We have in total 29 custom swords, 4 custom shields, and 3 custom tridents**

## Custom Models

*Some swords (mainly the lightsabers) were imported from other resourcepacks (this was made a long time ago and we're missing proper credits. Contact us for attribution.)* 

**Most of them** however were **built in Minecraft, on a creative server by [@elkiaclub](https://github.com/elkiaclub) members** and painstakingly **converted into models by [@APerfectPenguin](https://github.com/APerfectPenguin).**
